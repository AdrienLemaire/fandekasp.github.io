This post is a personal analyze of the **Productivity Methodology** called
[Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) and applications helping with it.


A Pomodoro is a kitchen timer used to measure 25-minute intervals. The name of
the Technique comes from the first timer used which was shaped like a tomato
(pomodoro in Italian).  This technique came out of frustration, when Francesco
Cirillo found himself in a slump, a time of low productivity and high confusion.
That confusion was due to a high number of distractions and interruptions as
well as a low level of concentration and motivation.

It has been inspired from the
[Timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) concept, Cognitive
techniques described by Buzan relating to how the mind works, Dynamics of play
outlined by Gadamer (a dynamic process that embraces children's play) and Notions
relating to structuring objectives and activities incrementally (Gilb).

The method can be summarized with the following rules:

* A Pomodoro Consists of 25 minutes Plus a Five-Minute Break
* After Every Four Pomodoros Comes a 15-30 Minute Break
* The Pomodoro Is Indivisible. There are no half or quarter Pomodoros.
* If a Pomodoro Begins, It Has to Ring:
  * If a Pomodoro is interrupted definitively – i.e. the interruption isn’t
    handled, it’s considered void, never begun, and it can’t be recorded with an X
  * If an activity is completed once a Pomodoro has already begun, continue
    reviewing the same activity until the Pomodoro rings
* Protect the Pomodoro. Inform effectively, negotiate quickly to
  reschedule the interruption, call back the person who interrupted you as agreed.
* If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down.
  Complex activities should be divided into several activities.
* If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up. Simple tasks can be combined.
* Results Are Achieved Pomodoro after Pomodoro.
* The Next Pomodoro Will Go Better.


It consists of five phases:

* **Planning** (at the start of the day) to decide on the day's activities
* **Tracking** (throughout the day) to gather raw data on the effort expended
  and other metrics of interest
* **Recording** (at the end of the day) to compile an archive of daily
  observations
* **Processing** (and the end of the day) to transform raw data into information
* **Visualizing** (at the end of the day) to present the information in a format
  that facilitates understanding and clarifies paths to improvement.

Note that an iteration is normally set to a day, but can be smaller depending on
the user experience and work habit.


All we need to use this technique are: a **Timer**, a **Todo Today Sheet**,
an **Activity Inventory Sheet**, and a **Records Sheet**.

![Tools required for Pomodoro](/images/pomodoro/tools.jpg)


The **Todo Today Sheet** is a table with 3 columns:
![Pomodoro Todo Today Sheet](/images/pomodoro/todo_today_sheet.png)

* The first is for the date (optional, can be retrieved at the end of the day
  during recording).
* The second if for the task title.
* The third is for estimating (using squares for 1st estimation and circles for
  2nd estimation), and tracking the number of pomodoros done per task (using
  crosses), as well as interruptions (apostrophe for an internal interruption,
  dash for an external one). The header can be filled with "place", "date",
  "author", and the "available Pomodoros" number estimated at the beginning of
  the day (usually set to 8).

Things to do during the day are ordered by priority on the sheet in the morning,
and a section "Unplanned & Urgent Activities" is left at the bottom of the sheet,
updated during the day (and it can modify the day's plan)

The **Activity Inventory Sheet** is similary a 3-columns table:

![Pomodoro Activity Inventory Sheet](/images/pomodoro/activity_inventory_sheet.png)

* The first column is for eventual due dates. It is also used to take note of
  Unplanned activities written during the day, using the letter U.
* The second column contains a number of lines where activities are noted down
  as they come up. At the end of the day, completed activities are checked off.
* The third column contains the estimated number of pomodoros for that task,
  evaluated in the morning.

The **Records Sheet** is used for recording, processing, and visualizing them at
the end of the end. It's a set of raw data needed to produce pertinent reports
and graphics. What you track and record depends on what you want to observe.
For example:

![Pomodoro Activity Inventory Sheet](/images/pomodoro/records_sheet.png)

* Date of completion (today)
* Start time (retrieved from todo today sheet, or by mentally remembering
  and reconstructing the start times for activities, which is a beneficial
  mental exercise).
* Type of Activity
* Description of Activity
* Estimate (estimated number of pomodoros)
* Real (real effort in pomodoros)
* Diff 1 (difference between the estimated effort and real effort)
* Diff 2 (difference between the first estimated effort and real effort)


The benefits of this method are multiple:

* Learning time, having a different experience of time. It takes no time to
  apply the pomodoro technique. But mastering it takes from 7 to 20 days of
  constant application. The first few days, one feels a sharper focus and
  increased concentration, the first 25 minutes seem slowlier. After a few days,
  the users can feel the mid-way point of 25 minutes, and soon users say they
  can feel when 5 minutes are left (feeling some sense of fatigue in those last
  minutes).
* Be more organized, prepare tasks and putting priorities. Althought I used to
  always note tasks somewhere and regularly looking through them to decide what
  to do next, I found that taking some time in the morning to dress a prioritized
  list is very useful (you won't need to think about what to do next during the
  day, you can see the end of your work/study iteration, and you can better
  appreciate the progress done).
* Be more aware, notice when you are getting distracted and strive to eliminate
  distractions. I've got this bad habit of always checking my emails as soon as
  they arrived. I thought it was great that I always had 0 unread emails in my
  inbox, but in reality, this small distraction only temporarily relieved me
  from the current activity/pain, and it made me loose focus, requiring much
  more time to get back into the rhythm.
* Be more analytic, learn from your way of working, find your weaknesses and set
  new objectives to improve those. As a very busy person full of hobbies and
  things I want to do, time is an extremely precious commodity to me. Being able
  to find ways to work faster, more efficiently, really enabled me to liberate a
  few more pomodoros and handle new types of activities (making me more busy in
  the end, but with an awesome feeling of completion and satisfaction).


I've had a hate and love experience with Pomodoro. Many times, I built some
motivations, found what seemed like a good application, then gave up after a few
days. This is due to several reasons:

* The application I tried at that time was no good.
* The application was good as a Timer, but not enabling me to properly use the
  method.
* I didn't study the method properly. One of the most important things to do
  before starting using Pomodoro is studying the method seriously. The book
  is short (38 pages), but studying it seriously took me 5 pomodoros!
* I studied the method but didn't do all the steps seriously (skipping on
  Recording, Processing and Visualizing).
* I didn't want to use paper because I thought it was too troublesome and not
  efficient enough.

Going back on my experience, it's clear that I was relying too much on the
application, hoping for it to provide me with everything I need to properly use
the Pomodoro Technique, and rejecting the fault on the application when failing.

So what about today ? Well, I'm compromising. So far I've been trying different
applications and [PomoTodo](https://pomotodo.com/app/) is my favorite one.

![PomoTodo](/images/pomodoro/pomotodo.png).

It's  multi-platform and multi-device, and I switch regularly between the mobile
and the web applications. The UI is clean and clutterless. It's rich in
features, and offers very interesting statistics. Really, compared to the dozen
of applications I tried before, it is a serious level above all of them.

Yet, this is not enough for a serious Pomodoro user. It doesn't provide
guidance/suggestions on when to do what phase, so you have to study the method
properly and know your stuff while using the application. It's just an
additional tool, not the whole user experience package. It doesn't make a
separation between **Todo Today** and **Activity** list (a choice they made when
deciding to mix both Pomdoro and
[GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) methods). It doesn't
enable the user to track internal and external interruptions, which is a major
part of the technique in order to learn from it and improve. It has a feature for
estimating the pomodoro count, but it's hidden (you need to first create the
task, then edit it to see this field). It could also be enriched with gamified
elements that make other timer applications popular like
[Forest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp&hl=en), but
this is a personal opinion, the technique never mentions gamification.


Since PomoTodo cannot offer everything needed to optimally use the
Technique, I also went back to using paper and pencil. Althought it's
cumbersome, the combination of both is working quite well for me so far.

But since I'm not satisfied, and since I'm a product maker, I'm on my way to
building a better productivity tool. This post is just the first of a series of
productivity posts to analyze popular methodologies and design a beautiful
application offering a great user experience. I'm a strong believer that we
shouldn't need paper/pencil today in order to be the most productive possible.

So here are some ideas I have on new features that I believe would be useful in
a Pomodoro application:

* **Progressive Learning**: The application should expect that a new user might
  not have read the book, and should teach him how to use it. Since the Pomodoro
  method itself has different levels of usage depending on the user experience,
  so should be the application, adding more expert features as it feels the user
  is getting the hang on the current routine.
* **Give all the tools**: A pomodoro applications should offer the 3 required
  parts, being a Todo Today sheet, an Activity Inventory Sheet and a Record Sheet. 
* **Notifications**: The application should trigger notifications at specific
  times defined by the user according to his lifestyle, to prompt him when he
  needs to plan his day, or start processing, visualizing, etc. This will help
  the user to build his habits and routine.
* **APIs**: It would be great for the application to have external integrations.
  One of my main problems is duplication of tasks and repetition between
  different tools I'm using: a Todo list, a Project Management tool, a Life
  Logger, a Calendar, etc. If adding a task somewhere could have it
  automatically replicated in the other tools following rules defined by the
  user, that would be awesome. Another benefit would be to reduce external
  distractions. For example, when someone messages me on Slack, they would
  receive an auto-reply telling them that I'll contact them back later, and my
  "Unplanned & Urgent" section would have this task automatically added.
* **Sharing**: While Pomodoro is not supposed to be used for external monitoring,
  I personally think I would feel much more committed if I could expose my
  tasklist to some friends, and I would appreciate having comments &
  encouragements from them to help me get more productive.


What about you ? What is your experience with Pomodoro, what tools did you
settle with to make the best out of this method ? How much did this method help
you with becoming more productive ?
