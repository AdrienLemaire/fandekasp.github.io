Why talking about calories ?

* There's been scientific researches proving that calorie-restricting increases
  lifespan → Therefore eating calories decreases lifespan, this is quite a
  troubling thought.
* I want to stay as active as I can, reduce injuries and feel good overall in my
  body. Being slim, I'm always trying to eat more to gain some kilos (hopefully
  as muscles) even though it's not working so much → There seems to be a
  contradiction between wanting to live a long lifespan and wanting to be fit
  and athlete-looking.

I'd like to resolve this contradiction by studying researches that have been
done and reaching my own conclusions on this matter.

In addition, I'll take the opportunity to think of ways to stay aware about
calories daily, how to keep track of them while I'm not the one cooking, how to
evaluate the potential gains brought by reducing calory absorption, etc.

I realize that I've always given up tracking calories because of how approximate
and time consuming these measures are.

# Calorie restriction

The principle is about reducing the number of calories that you absorb, without
reaching malnutrition.
According to Wikipedia, calorie restriction has shown a slow-down of the aging
process in several species: yeast, fish, rodents and dogs. Benefits are:

* Maintenance of youthful health
* Increase in median and maximum lifespan

A study on monkeys sharing 93% of the human genome has shown that caloric
restriction had a positive results, especially on female.


# Human Lifespan

The [Hayflick limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit) represents
how many times human cells can divide.
It appears that a cell will divide between 40 and 60 times, its telomeres
getting shorter with each division.

While reducing calory intake might slow down cell division, it can also have
unhealthy side effects and make one prone to injuries and sickness.


# Notes

BMR: Basal Metabolic Rate (number of calories burnt by the body to handle basic,
day-to-day physiological functions and maintenance).
    → 29 years old male, 183cm tall and 75kg, my BMR is 1754 calories/day.
TDEE: Total Daily Energy Expenditure
    → With 14.9% body fat (athletes have 6~14%) and being moderately active, I need between 2733
    (maintainance) and
    3280 (muscle gain) calories per day.
        * carbohydrate 376~434g (55.1~58.4%)
        * Protein 136g (19.9~16.6%)
        * Fat 76~91g (25%)


Yesterday (June 3rd), I used 2642 calories swimming 2.5kg and cycling 57km in
hills. Hence I suppose I should have eaten 1754+2642 = 4396 calories (which I
clearly didn't ...).


Macros formula:
* protein ratio: 0.825 grams per pound of bodyweight
* Fats: 25% of daily energy expenditure
* carbohydrate grams come from remainder

3500 calories in a pound of fat


I truly dislike counting calories because of how approximative measures are:
* too difficult to count how many calories are in a meal
* difficult to see how much of that meal I ate
* impossible to see how much did I really absorb (not chewing enough will block
  absorption)
* Even laws allow a 20% margin of error on the nutrition facts panel
