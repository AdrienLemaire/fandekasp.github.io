Why talking about calories ?

* There's been scientific researches proving that calorie-restricting increases
  lifespan → Therefore eating calories decreases lifespan, this is quite a
  troubling thought.
* I want to stay as active as I can, reduce injuries and feel good overall in my
  body. Being slim, I'm always trying to eat more to gain some kilos (hopefully
  as muscles) even though it's not working so much → There seems to be a
  contradiction between wanting to live a long lifespan and wanting to be fit
  and athlete-looking.

I'd like to resolve this contradiction by studying researches that have been
done and reaching my own conclusions on this matter.

In addition, I'll take the opportunity to think of ways to stay aware about
calories daily, how to keep track of them while I'm not the one cooking, how to
evaluate the potential gains brought by reducing calory absorption, etc.
