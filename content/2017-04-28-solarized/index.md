There are many other interesting color schemes out there, like
[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), but I won't discuss the
differences between each palette in this article.

I have been using Solarized for several years now. A recurrent issue when 
setting up my system is to homogeneize colors across applications).

While it would be nice to see applications reuse default colors, they
unfortunately define their own set of colors, and we therefore need to copy the
solarized color palette in each of these configuration files.

Imagine you are running Vim within Tmux, both setup with solarized dark colors,
and want to switch to the light theme because you're working outside or near a
window around noon. You might already have a vim binding allowing you to toggle
the colorscheme mode within your current session, but then you'll be struck by
the high contrast between the tmux dark colors shown in other panes and the vim
light colors in your current pane. Moreover, if you'd like to reopen a new vim
session, you'll be back to the default theme, which is rather annoying.

![Solarized contrast in Vim and
Tmux](solarized_vim_tmux_contrast.png)

Here's how I smoothly transition between light and dark mode for all applications using a shortcut.

# [](#configure-solarized-with)Configure Solarized with ...

## [](#xresources)Xresources

> **Xresources** is a user-level configuration dotfile, used to set X resources
> used by X client applications.

I truly wish applications would comply entirely to the colors specified in the
Xresources so that we wouldn't need to configure our palette in so many
different places.

Therefore, I went and created 2 files, called `~/.Xresources-light`
and `~/.Xresources-dark` files, then symlinked the current theme to
`~/.Xresources`.

Example for `~/.Xresources-dark`:

```sh
! Solarized theme
! Common
#define S_yellow        #b58900
#define S_orange        #cb4b16
#define S_red           #dc322f
#define S_magenta       #d33682
#define S_violet        #6c71c4
#define S_blue          #268bd2
#define S_cyan          #2aa198
#define S_green         #859900

! Dark
#define S_base03        #002b36
#define S_base02        #073642
#define S_base01        #586e75
#define S_base00        #657b83
#define S_base0         #839496
#define S_base1         #93a1a1
#define S_base2         #eee8d5
#define S_base3         #fdf6e3
```

Then I updated the X11 configuration with xrdb.

```console
$ xrdb -load ${HOME}/.Xresources
```

Rofi's configuration also goes in the Xresources files.

Example for `~/.Xresources-dark`:

```sh
!                  bg         border   separator
rofi.color-window: #dd002b36, #002b36, #dd073642
!                  bg         fg       altbg      hlbg       hlfg
rofi.color-normal: #dd002b36, #839496, #00002b36, #dd073642, #859900
rofi.color-active: #dd002b36, #268bd2, #00002b36, #dd073642, #268bd2
rofi.color-urgent: #dd002b36, #d33682, #00002b36, #dd073642, #d33682
```

Here is how it looks for me:

![rofi dark & light examples](rofi-solarized.png)

## [](#dircolors)Dircolors

> dircolors is the color setup for the `ls` command.

To have ls colorize the directory/files in a solarized fashion, we need to
specify the dircolors parameters. I went with the
[joel-porquet/zsh-dircolors-solarized](https://github.com/joel-porquet/zsh-dircolors-solarized) plugin for [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/).

Using [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) to manage my zsh plugins, I
added the following line to my `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
zgen load joel-porquet/zsh-dircolors-solarized
```

Here is an example of dircolors from Termite with 80% transparency:

## [](#i3)i3

> i3 is a tiling window manager, allowing one to always see all opened
> windows, without them stacking above each other. With plenty of keystrokes,
> it makes it possible to control every windows only using the keyboard, making
> the mouse pretty much useless.

My i3 stack consists of:

* [i3-gaps-next](https://github.com/Airblader/i3), the
  development branch of a fork of i3wm offering more features, like gaps
  between windows instead of borders.
* [i3blocks](https://github.com/Airblader/i3blocks-gaps) for the status line
* [i3lock](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/) as screen locker.

In addition, for my solarized theme switcher, I used
a fork of [i3-style](https://github.com/acrisci/i3-style), where I defined my
own transparent solarized themes, since I wasn't satisfied by the existing
theme.

To execute the script, I added a new binding in i3's configuration file:

```sh
bindsym $mod+b  exec --no-startup-id ${HOME}/scripts/toggle_solarized_theme.sh
```

My `$mod` button is set to <kbd>Mod4</kbd>, which is the Windows key in my XPS
13. Hence, whenever I press <kbd>Mod4</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd>, my applications will
toggle between dark and light solarized modes.
The **b** in the keystroke stands for "Background".

Finally, I added the following contents to the script:

```bash
#i3-style solarized-transparent-${newmode} -o ${HOME}/.config/i3/config --reload
coffee ${HOME}/scripts/cli.coffee solarized-transparent-${newmode} -o ${HOME}/.config/i3/config --reload
```

If my [pull request]() gets accepted upstream, I'll be able to use the normal
i3-style script instead of the current coffee command.

For my statusbar, I only used accent colors to underline each i3block.

Here is how my i3 statusbar looks like:

![i3blocks solarized](i3blocks-solarized.jpg)

## [](#feh) feh

> feh is an image viewer that can also be used to set the desktop background
> image.

To set the background image, simply pass the `--bg-fill` parameter to feh:

```sh
$ feh --bg-fill "${HOME}.config/wallpapers/solarized-mountains-${newmode}.png"
```

That will also create a file `~/.fehbg`, which can then be reused.
In my i3 configuration, I added the following line for that purpose:

```sh
exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.fehbg
```

For background image, I took a dark solarized image from [Deviant
Art](http://9beat7.deviantart.com/art/Solarized-Mountains-530027093):

![solarized background dark](solarized-mountains-dark.png)

Then I modified it with [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to get a light solarized version.
You normally only need to change the 4 background/foreground colors when
toggling mode, accent colors staying the same in both modes. But the artist here
used a darkened version of 4 accent colors to ease the transition between
accent colors and the background color. Hence, I had to modify these shaded
parts into their lightened counterpart.
Here is how I proceeded:

```python
def get_halfway_color(al, bl):
    '''Function to calculate the color in-between two HSL colors'''
    for a,b in zip(al,bl):
        yield min([a,b])+abs(a-b)/2

# [Hue, Saturation, Lightness]
bg_light = [46, 11, 93]
gold = [45, 100, 71]
red = [1, 79, 87]
purple = [238, 44, 77]
green = [175, 71, 63]

for color in [gold, red, purple, green]:
    print(list(get_halfway_color(bg_light, color)))

# Output: 
# [45.5, 55.5, 82.0]
# [23.5, 45.0, 90.0]
# [142.0, 27.5, 85.0]
# [110.5, 41.0, 78.0]
```

Why did I use HSL colors instead of RGB ? Because it's a much more intuitive way
to find colors. After playing with it for a bit, I decided to only change the
saturation and lightness, which gave the following result.

![solarized background light](solarized-mountains-light.png)

Note that it would have been ideal to work with CIELab colors, but since Gimp
was showing HSL colors right off the bat, it was just simpler to go this way.


## [](#termite) Termite

> After using [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) for many
> years, I switched to Termite, which behaves similarly in many ways and offers
> painless configuration like adding true transparency.

To set the solarized colors on Termite, edit the `~/.config/termite/config` file
and add the **[colors]** section. I used the configuration shared by
[alpha-omega/termite-colors-solarized](https://github.com/alpha-omega/termite-colors-solarized)
for that purpose.

What I did was copying the `solarized-dark` and `solarized-light` files in
`~/.config/termite/`, adding my other termite configs to each file.

Then, similarly to Xresources, changing the termite solarized theme can be done
as follows:

1. Symlink the theme file to config: `cd ~/.config/termite && ln -sf
   solarized-<dark|light> config`
2. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>R</kbd> to reload the terminal.

**Note:** _Only 4 lines differ between both configuration files, so there should
be a smarter way to include them in the main config._

To reload the terminal programmatically, I proceed as follows:

```sh
$ ln -sf ${config}-$newmode $config
$ killall -USR1 termite
```

## [](#neovim)NeoVim

> [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) is a highly configurable text editor forked from Vim.

For Vim, I re-used the color palette defined by
[lifepillar/vim-solarized8](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8), and
added the following in my `~/.vimrc`:

```VimL
Plug 'lifepillar/vim-solarized8'

nnoremap  <leader>B :<c-u>exe "colors" (g:colors_name =~# "dark"
    \ ? substitute(g:colors_name, 'dark', 'light', '')
    \ : substitute(g:colors_name, 'light', 'dark', '')
    \ )<cr>

fun! Solarized8Contrast(delta)
  let l:schemes = map(['_low', '_flat', '', '_high'], '"solarized8_".(&background).v:val')
  exe 'colors' l:schemes[((a:delta+index(l:schemes, g:colors_name)) % 4 + 4) % 4]
endf

nmap <leader>- :<c-u>call Solarized8Contrast(-v:count1)<cr>
nmap <leader>+ :<c-u>call Solarized8Contrast(+v:count1)<cr>
```

This allows me to use Solarized with True colors (24-bit colors, or 16 million
colors, supported by Termite). It also adds two interesting key bindings (my
Leader key being <kbd>,</kbd>):

* <kbd>,</kbd>-<kbd>B</kbd> will toggle the dark and light modes in Vim
* <kbd>,</kbd>-<kbd>-</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd>-<kbd>+</kbd> allow me to change the
  contrast of the selected mode.

**Note:** I'm using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as Vim
plugin manager, which is simple to use and full of smart features, for example
allowing to lazy-load modules when their command is called.

```bash
pattern="colorscheme solarized8_"
perl -e "s/${pattern}${oldmode}/${pattern}${newmode}/g" -pi ${HOME}.vimrc
for socket in /tmp/nvimsocket*; do
    nvr --servername $socket --remote-send ",B<Enter>";
done;
```

Then, I used [nvr](https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote) to send a color
toggle command to running vim sessions. The reason I used it is that the
[+clientserver](https://neovim.io/doc/user/remote.html#clientserver) of neovim
goes through the X-server (like [vim
--remote](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/remote.html) for that matter),
or I'm working with neovim in a terminal without GUI.
To create new nvim servers everytime I open vim, I added to my `~/.zshrc` file
the following:

```zsh
function vim () {
    COUNT=$(($((ls /tmp/nvimsocket*) 2>&/dev/null|tail -n 1|grep -Po 'nvimsocket\K[0-9]*$') + 1))
    printf -v COUNT "%05d" $COUNT
    NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS=/tmp/nvimsocket${COUNT} nvim $@
}
```
This function will create a new socket file suffixed with an incremented number,
so that nvr can easily retrieve all server and send them update commands.
**Note:** neovim-remote has now [fixed the
--serverlist](https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote/issues/40) option, so we
could refactore this piece of code.

## [](#gtk) GTK

> The [GIMP Toolkit](https://www.gtk.org/) is a platform for creating graphical
> user interfaces.

Since I'm using several GTK 2.0 applications, like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/),
[Thunar](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) or
[Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/), it also makes sense to update
the gtk 2.0 color theme.

I went with the [Numix
Solarized](https://github.com/Ferdi265/numix-solarized-gtk-theme) themes.
While the light theme looks pretty, I found some issues with the dark theme,
especially unusable with my file manager Thunar. Hence, after fiddling a bit
with the gtkrc file, I submitted a [Pull
Request](https://github.com/Ferdi265/numix-solarized-gtk-theme/pull/11) to solve
this issue.

To update opened applications, I re-used [cpoakes'
script](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=428517#p428517) to send events.

```sh
$ echo "include \"/usr/share/themes/NumixSolarized$([[ $newmode == 'dark' ]] \
    && echo 'Dark')/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\"" > ${HOME}/.gtkrc-2.0
$ python2.7 ${HOME}/scripts/gtkreload &
```

## [](#chrome)Google Chrome

I will discuss here a solution to customize Chrome using an extension-like
theme. It can then be uploaded to the Chrome store and used by anyone from there.

Note that Google Chrome also has GTK 2.0 support, but will eventually use GTK 3.0 by
default (currently implemented in a fork of Chromium, the Open Source project
from which Google Chrome is based). To enable the GTK theme, Go to **Settings**, then
**Appearance** and click on `Use GTK+ theme`.
If the theme looks broken, try restarting Chrome. I figured out too late that
the GTK theme isn't applied correctly to the top menu and tabs when clicking on
`Use GTK+ theme` or using the gtkreload script, which is why I went with the theme extension solution. 
Since the Chrome header isn't updated properly (requiring to restart Chrome for
the theme to fully take effect) and since I wasn't entirely satisfied
with the Numix theme for Chrome anyways, I'll keep using my solution for the
time being.

I used this [Solarized Dark
theme](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/solarized-dark/kedemblecjmofcmppbecaagebmokigml), and since I couldn't find a Solarized Light version, I [built it myself](https://github.com/Fandekasp/google-chrome-solarized-light).

I couldn't figure out any way to reload Chrome the same way it reloads itself when
updating the settings or installing a new theme from the Chrome store.
Therefore, I went with a restart approach, specifying the
`--load-extension=/path/to/theme` parameter to the google google-chrome
executable. Another problem naturally occured from that decision: When
restarting an application, i3 will detect the windows being closed and
automatically re-tile the other windows, then repeat the process once chrome is
restarted, potentially breaking the window layout we had defined prior to
changing the theme. To avoid this issue, we can improve the script to save the
current layout before closing Chrome, then restore the layout once Chrome is
restarted.

```bash
if [[ $(ps auxw|grep chrome|grep -v grep|wc -l) -gt 0 ]]; then
    mapfile -t workspaces <<< $(i3-msg -t get_workspaces | jq -r '.[] | .name')

    # Add save-tree logic here
    for ws in "${workspaces[@]}"; do
        i3-save-tree --workspace "$ws" > ~/.config/i3sessions/workspace-${ws:0:1}.json
        # Swallows all
        perl -e "s/\/\/ \"/\"/g" -pi ~/.config/i3sessions/workspace-${ws:0:1}.json
    done

    # Kill Chrome
    killall chrome

    # Swallow other windows
    ids=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --name '.*')
    IFS='
    '
    ids=( $ids )
    for id in "${ids[@]}"; do
        xdotool windowunmap $id
    done

    # Restore logic
    for ws in "${workspaces[@]}"; do
        i3-msg "workspace $ws; append_layout ~/.config/i3sessions/workspace-${ws:0:1}.json"
    done

    # Go back to first workspace
    i3-msg "workspace ${workspaces[0]}"

    # Restart Chrome
    exec google-chrome-stable --load-extension=${HOME}/Projects/personal/google-chrome-solarized-${newmode}-theme &

    # Give some time for i3 to append the layout and chrome to start
    sleep 0.5

    # Unswallow other windows
    for id in "${ids[@]}"; do
        xdotool windowmap $id
    done
fi
```

While saving the layout with `i3-save-tree` is straightforward, restoring it
with `i3-msg "append_layout ..."` was quite difficult, because it will simply
add new containers next to existing containers. The trick was to use `xdotool`
to swallow existing windows like Termite, and unswallow them for i3 to add them
back in the new layout.

To clarify the terminology here, "swallowing" is similar to sending a window to
the scratchpad, or in other words hide the window in a virtual workspace, which
is managed by xdotool.


# [](#resulting-script)Resulting script

To update everything at once from a single script, all that is left is finding the
current theme and execute each bit while calling the new theme.

I used the termite configuration file as base to retrieve the current mode and
define the new mode:

```bash
HOME=/home/dori/
config=${HOME}.config/termite/config
oldmode=$([[ -z $(diff $config ${config}-dark) ]] && echo 'dark' || echo 'light')
newmode=$([[ $oldmode == 'dark' ]] && echo 'light' || echo 'dark')
```

The line `[[ -z $(diff $config $dark) ]]` runs a diff between the config file
and the dark one. If the result is empty (both files are the same), then let's
symlink the light configuration, otherwise let's symlink the dark one.

**Note**: _Since we're symlinking files, there should be a smarter way to
compare them than running diff._

And we're done! You can see below the full script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

termite_conf=${HOME}/.config/termite/config
oldmode=$([[ -z $(diff $termite_conf ${termite_conf}-dark) ]] && echo 'dark' || echo 'light')
newmode=$([[ $oldmode == 'dark' ]] && echo 'light' || echo 'dark')

# i3

done;

    # Add save-tree logic here
    for ws in "${workspaces[@]}"; do
        i3-save-tree --workspace "$ws" > ~/.config/i3sessions/workspace-${ws:0:1}.json
        # Swallows all
        perl -e "s/\/\/ \"/\"/g" -pi ~/.config/i3sessions/workspace-${ws:0:1}.json
    done

    # Kill Chrome
    killall chrome

    # Swallow other windows
    ids=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --name '.*')
    IFS='
    '
    ids=( $ids )
    for id in "${ids[@]}"; do
        xdotool windowunmap $id
    done

    # Restore logic
    for ws in "${workspaces[@]}"; do
        i3-msg "workspace $ws; append_layout ~/.config/i3sessions/workspace-${ws:0:1}.json"
    done

    # Go back to first workspace
    i3-msg "workspace ${workspaces[0]}"

    # Restart Chrome
    exec google-chrome-stable --load-extension=${HOME}/Projects/personal/google-chrome-solarized-${newmode}-theme &

    # Give some time for i3 to append the layout and chrome to start
    sleep 0.5

    # Unswallow other windows
    for id in "${ids[@]}"; do
        xdotool windowmap $id
    done
fi
```

And you can see here how it looks like for me:

# [](#conclusion)Conclusion

As always, Linux is flexible enough to allow for any kind of customization, but
it takes a lot of time to set up things the way we like.
I didn't need to go so far into customizing my themes and did it for the sake of
this article in hope that it will help other people using similar applications.
But the result is satisfying, and it has proven very useful everytime I was in a
bright or dark environment.


What could be improved ?

* Replace the vim/nvr logic using the `--serverlist` option.
* Time the execution of each part of the script, then re-order them accordingly to
  reduce the total load time and minimize the flickering effect when restoring the
  i3 layout.
* Start chrome with cached pages, do not reload all tabs.
* Go back to using the GTK theme for Chrome, update the theme to give a better
  look-and-feel, then investigate how to force colors to update in the header
  menu with gtkreload and remove the i3 save & restore layout code.
* Integrate more applications: try the fork of [Chromium with GTK
  3.20](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromium-gtk3/) support
  and update its related theme; set up solarized colors for
  [irssi](https://irssi.org/),
  [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube), Qt4 applications, etc.
