Blog made with the Gutenberg Rust package.
I truly dislike blogging for many reasons (lack of writing skills, time,
dedication, â€¦) but got remotivated by friends of mine who believe this would do
me good.

I will be writing about everything and anything (if I do not give up within
months like many times in the past). I'm interested in researching and
developing some ideas of mine very deeply, to bring something valuable to each
of my posts.

If you have any critic regarding a post, please contact me. It'll help me
improve it.
If you find a post interesting, please let me know. It'll help me stay
motivated.
If you would like me to write about a precise topic, ask me about it. If I'm
interested, I'll raise its priority

## Todo list

* Music: Study famous classical composers, extract patterns and build mnemonics
  to recognize each's style and maybe try to compose similarly.
* Deep Learning:
    * Write about DL with local(cpu)/AWS/GCE and share code to start cheap
  servers. Develop on performance monitoring / debugging /visulaization and other tools to do
  deep learning efficiently.
    * Investigate why Convolutional networks are most performant for any time-based
      series.
* Triathlon: Share all tips I've accumulated on the 3 legs of the sport. Maybe
  make animations to illustrate.
* Health: research effect of calories on human body and draw my own conclusions
  on the best way to stay fit and athlete while increasing chances to live
  longer.
* Japanese: Different methods to study, mnemonics & tips, kanji, kansaiben
* Politic
* Education (Moocs vs traditional school, how to get over walls).
* Investing  (Shares, ventures, FX, cryptocurrencies). Pros & cons, how-to
* Entrepreneurship
* IT challenges (eg HackerRank)
* Overview of latest technologies / current limits of human knowledge. Make
  educated guesses for future predictions.
