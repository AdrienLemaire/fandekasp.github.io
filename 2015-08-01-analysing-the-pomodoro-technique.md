This post is a personal analyze of the **Productivity Methodology** called
[Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) and applications helping with it.

# What is Pomodoro ?

A Pomodoro is a kitchen timer used to measure 25-minute intervals. The name of
the Technique comes from the first timer used which was shaped like a tomato
(pomodoro in Italian).  This technique came out of frustration, when Francesco
Cirillo found himself in a slump, a time of low productivity and high confusion.
That confusion was due to a high number of distractions and interruptions as
well as a low level of concentration and motivation.

<!--more-->

The method can be summarized with the following rules:

* A Pomodoro Consists of 25 minutes Plus a Five-Minute Break
* After Every Four Pomodoros Comes a 15-30 Minute Break
* The Pomodoro Is Indivisible. There are no half or quarter Pomodoros.
* If a Pomodoro Begins, It Has to Ring:
  * If a Pomodoro is interrupted definitively – i.e. the interruption isn’t
    handled, it’s considered void, never begun, and it can’t be recorded with an X
  * If an activity is completed once a Pomodoro has already begun, continue
    reviewing the same activity until the Pomodoro rings
* Protect the Pomodoro. Inform effectively, negotiate quickly to
  reschedule the interruption, call back the person who interrupted you as agreed.
* If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down.
  Complex activities should be divided into several activities.
* If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up. Simple tasks can be combined.
* Results Are Achieved Pomodoro after Pomodoro.
* The Next Pomodoro Will Go Better.


It consists of five phases:

* **Planning** (at the start of the day) to decide on the day's activities
* **Tracking** (throughout the day) to gather raw data on the effort expended
  and other metrics of interest
* **Recording** (at the end of the day) to compile an archive of daily
  observations
* **Processing** (and the end of the day) to transform raw data into information
* **Visualizing** (at the end of the day) to present the information in a format
  that facilitates understanding and clarifies paths to improvement.

Note that an iteration is normally set to a day, but can be smaller depending on
the user experience and work habit.


All we need to use this technique are: a **Timer**, a **Todo Today Sheet**,
an **Activity Inventory Sheet**, and a **Records Sheet**.

![Tools required for Pomodoro](/images/pomodoro/tools.jpg)



The **Todo Today Sheet** is a table with 3 columns:

* The first is for the date (optional, can be retrieved at the end of the day
  during recording).
* The second if for the task title.
* The third is for estimating (using squares for 1st estimation and circles for
  2nd estimation), and tracking the number of pomodoros done per task (using
  crosses), as well as interruptions (apostrophe for an internal interruption,
  dash for an external one). The header can be filled with "place", "date",
  "author", and the "available Pomodoros" number estimated at the beginning of
  the day (usually set to 8).

Things to do during the day are ordered by priority on the sheet, and a section
"Unplanned & Urgent Activities" is left at the bottom of the sheet, updated
during the day (and it can modify the day's plan)

The **Activity Inventory Sheet** is similary a 3-columns table:

* The first column is for eventual due dates. It is also used to take note of
  Unplanned activities written during the day, using the letter U.
* The second column contains a number of lines where activities are noted down
  as they come up. At the end of the day, completed activities are checked off.
* A **Records Sheet** (recording, processnig, visualizing): set of raw data
  needed to produce pertinent reports and graphics. Includes date, description,
  number of pomodoros worth of effort needed to accomplish a task. Updated once
  a day in the evening.

The benefits of this method are multiple:

* Learning time, having a different experience of time.
* Be more organized, prepare tasks and putting priorities
* Be more aware, notice when you are getting distracted and strive to eliminate
  distractions.
* Be more analytic, learn from your way of working, find your weaknesses and set
  new objectives to improve those.


# Pomodoro apps: pros and cons

Pomodoro is always listed in the top Productivity Methodologies. If
you've been interested by productivity apps before, there's no doubt you've
already heard of Pomodoro. Maybe you even tried an app, or several. And you
might be part of the majority of people that didn't get hooked up to it and
stopped using it very quickly.
It might be a bit of your fault (lack of motivation, perseverance,
self-discipline), but it's without doubt mostly due to the applications you
used not being able to deliver a good user experience.

When it comes to finding an application to use, it's extremely difficult to
choose: There are more than a hundred pomodoro apps in Google's Play store.
Maybe you found some recommendations and tried applications like 
[Forest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp&hl=en),
[Pomodoro Challenge Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en),
[PomoTodo](https://pomotodo.com/app/), 
[Pomodoro.cc](http://pomodoro.cc/) or others. Yet you didn't manage to stick to
it and build the habits to use Pomodoro regularly.

One of the most important things to do before starting using Pomodoro is
studying the method! The book is short (38 pages), althought it can take up to 5
pomodoros to study it completely. If you do not understand what the method is
about, what are the different steps to take, and levels to improve the
technique, you won't improve with time, and eventually get disappointed.
But for those who did their work and understand perfectly the method, I can bet
that almost all of them got disappointed by existing apps, since none provide
adequate tools to fully embrace that method, and following the method
recommendations, they will have switched to paper and pencil to record their
pomodoro and track their progress.

Let's have a closer look of the applications metionned above:

## Forest

![Forest](/images/pomodoro/forest.jpg)

Pros:

* Excellent UI design
* Gamified interface
* Simple and Easy to use

Cons:

This is not a pomodoro application. It's a very simple timer, blocked on 30
minutes iterations, preventing you to use your smartphone even if you do need to
use it for a task. The history contains too few informations for a proper
analysis, there isn't any recording and the app doesn't allow for more advanced
uses of Pomodoro.
While they do not refer to themselves as being a Pomodoro application, lot of
its users are talking about it that way.

## Pomodoro Challenge Timer

![Pomodoro Challenge Timer](/images/pomodoro/pomodoro-challenge-timer.png)

Pros:

* Gamified with achievements
* Simple to use
* Concept of projects

Cons:

* Insulting. While achievement-based products are focused on rewarding the user,
  Pomodoro Challenge Timer won't hesitate to judge and nag you. There is an
  option to disable it, but it also disables the achievements system, making for
  a boring application.
* It has some statistics, but not on the points that the method recommends to
  analyse. It lacks the 3 essentials sheets "Todo Today Sheet", "Activity
  Inventory Sheet", and "Records Sheet". It does not offer any estimation
  feature.


## Pomodoro.cc

![Pomodoro-cc](/images/pomodoro/pomodoro-cc.jpg)

[For Marcel to fill]


## Pomotodo

![PomoTodo](/images/pomodoro/pomotodo.png)

Pros:

* Multi-platform
* Clean design
* Interesting statistics

Cons:

* No guidance (suggestions to prepare the day in the morning, review in the
  evening)
* Single todolist, missing separation between Todo Today and Activity Inventory
* Missing features to track internal and external distractions
* No gamification, important motivator although not recommended by the method
* Lack of estimation feature, very important part of the method (how many
  pomodoros should be assigned to a task ?)
* Lack of Daily available pomodoros (usually one will plan for 8 pomodoros). It
  does offer a "Expected pomo count" field, but it's a hidden feature, and the
  user should be prompted for that information at the beginning of the day.
* Doesn't incite to prioritize tasks: tasks can be reordered, but the method
  strongly recommends to order them at the beginning of the day, and keep
  working on 1 tasks at the time until it's done)

 
Pomotodo is most probably the best Pomodoro application out there today. But its
attempt to handle both Pomodoro Method and [Get Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) 
Method isn't good enough. In the end, the best tool today to properly follow the
Pomodoro Method is still paper and pencil unfortunately.


# Toward a better application

There is no doubt that an excellent Pomodoro application could be made and
completely eradicate the need for paper/pencil. Here is what the perfect
application for me should look like:


What all existing applications are lacking is progressive learning, a teaching
feature, starting simple and enabling more advanced features as the user gets
the hang of the method. Start easy, then after some time has passed and progresses
have shown up, ask the user for more complex operations, all while explaining him why.

The application should respect the Pomodoro method. We need a Todo Today sheet,
an Activity inventory sheet and a Record sheet, yet most of the applications do
not offer those tools. Any user who studied the method and wants to follow it
the right way will quickly be frustrated and switch back to paper/pencil, or
give up on the method altogether.

The application should trigger notifications at specific times defined by the
user according to his lifestyle, to prompt the user when he needs to plan his
day, or start processing, visualizing, etc, to help the user get those habits. 

APIs and external integrations are indispensable, and one of the most important
features that a productivity app should have:
* Integrations to communication tools like Slack can help us manage external
  distractions (eg when someone messages us, they would receive an auto-reply
  telling them that we will contact them again later, and maybe auto-add a new
  Unplanned task to the list).
* Integrations to other todolists, project management tools, life loggers and
  calendars would solve a huge problem: Repetition and Duplication of tasks
  over different tools. For example, when adding a meeting to our calendar, the
  pomodoro application should automatically have a new task added to its
  Activity Inventory sheet with due date.

An important optional social component is sharing. While Pomodoro is not supposed to
be used for external monitoring, some people will feel much more committed when
exposing their tasklist, and will appreciate having comments / encouragements.



# What about you ?

We want to know more about you too! Please share with us your experience, your
favorite application if you have one, or if you would like to see yet another
Pomodoro app, doing it the right way this time.

Let's work together on making better tools to improve people's productivity,
efficiency, and overall well-being.

# Reading notes (to remove once the post is written)

Objectives:

* Find out how much effort an activity requires
* Cut down on interruptions
* Estimate the effort for activities
* Make the pomodoro more effective
* Set up a timetable


Results:

* Learning time
* ...

Conclusions:

* Inverting the dependency on time
* Regulating complexity
* Detachment
* Observation and continual feedback
* Sustainable pace


Assumptions:

* Different way of seeing time alleviates anxiety and in doing so leads to
  enhanced personal effectiveness
* Better use of the mind enables us to achieve greater clarity of thoughts,
  higher consciousness, and sharper focus, all the while facilitating learning.
* Employing easy-to-use, unobtrusive tools reduces the complexity of applying
  the Technique while favoring continuity, and allows you to cconcentrate your
  efforts on the activities you want to accomplish.


Inspiration:

* Time-boxing
* Cognitive techniques described by Buzan relating to how the mind works
* Dynamics of play outlined by Gadamer
* Notions relating to structuring objectives and activities incrementally (Gilb)



Traditional pomodoro: 30 min (25 min work + 5 min break). This is an atomic unit
of time, indivisible. If a pomodoro is interrupted, it should be considered
void, and restarted. Once the 25min work is finished, you're not allowed to keep
on working "just for a few more minutes", even if you're convinced that in those
few minutes you could complete the task at hand.
The 3-5 min break gives time to "disconnect" from the work, and assimilate
what's been learned in the last 25 min. It allows to do healthy activities
(drink water, deep breathing, stretching exercises, joke, fantasize about the
next vacations, etc). Don't talk about work-related issues with a colleague,
don't make a phone call and don't write emails.

Every 4 pomodoro, a longer break is needed (15~30 min). 

If a task is finished before a pomodoro ended:
  * Do **overlearning**: review or repeat what you've done, make small
    improvements, note down what you've learned.
  * If the task is finished within 5 min, cancel the pomodoro and start a new
    one for the following task.

End of every day:

* Completed pomodoros transferred to hard-copy archive
* present a report with nb pomodoro / task to show effort expended: date, start
  time, type of activity, description of the activity, nb of pomodoros, short
  notes (results achieved, possible room for improvements, problems that
  happened)
 

Cut down on interruptions:

* **internal**: need to eat, drink, start a different task that seems urgent.
  This is procrastination, showing problems of concentration. To work on this,
  be aware of interruptions and clearly note them down as an apostrophe. Then
  add the new task in the "Unplanned & Urgent" section, or in the "Activity
  inventory" with a deadline if not so urgent.
  It's interesting to notice at the end of the day that seemingly urgent tasks
  aren't so important, and will be moved to the activity inventory or even
  deleted because they became irrelevant.
* **external**: interrupted by others. Solutions are similar to handling internal
  interruptions: Disable sonore alarms, tell the person that you're busy and
  can't be interrupted (inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule the
  interruption, etc). True emergencies that cannot wait 25min are very rare.
  People can have 10 to 15 interruptions in a single pomodoro, but if
  interruptions are well managed, it will decrease with time and interrupters
  will actually help protect the pomodoro. When an external interruption
  happens, put a dash on the sheet, apply the Inform, Negotiate and Call
  strategy. Then add the new activity in unplanned & urgent, or in the Activity
  inventory with a "U" and deadline if needed.
  If a pomodoro is definitely interrupted (real emergency or human weaknesss), it
  should be void, even if it's about to ring, and add a dash to the pomodoro
  records.

We should delay unplanned & urgent tasks as much as possible, and reduce the
number of pomodoros used to organize those interruptions. Pleople starting to
use pomodoro often end up with 2~3 pomodoros of dedicated work/study, with the
rest of pomodoros used for unplanned tasks.

Once we start mastering pomodoro, we can work on quantitative estimates,
long-term objective being to succesfully predict the effert that an activity
requires.

At the start of the day, estimate how many pomodoros each activity in
the inventory will take (revise previous estimates if needed). Log these
estimations in the "bank". If an estimate is greater than 5~7 pomodoros, then
it's probably too complex and you should break it down in smaller tasks. If
tasks take less than a pomodoro, add them up (a pomodoro is indivisible)

When preparing the Today's tasklist, decide on the number of pomodoros to handle
(8 pomodoros is good), then choose your tasks from their pomodoro estimate until
you reach your daily quota. If tasks are completed faster than expected and
time frees up at the end of the day, pick new tasks from the inventory then.

When starting pomodoro, always start with the first activity on the list, and
keep working on it until it's done.

Advanced estimates recording:

* Analyze the estimation error (diff between actual effort and estimated one)
* Show re-estimations diff (diff between actual effort and first estimation)

how to improve quantitative estimates: eliminate the 3rd estimate while keeping
the overall margin of error small; eliminate the 2nd estimate; Reduce the margin
of error in the 1st estimate.

Manage exploration. Research tasks, preparing for tasks, all exploration tasks
can also be timeboxed in pomodoro and analyzed to see how much time is spent on
it.


Objective 4: Make the pomodoro more effective

1st evolution: use the first 3~5 min of each pomodoro to briefly repeat what
we've learned since the beginning of the activity (not just the last pomodoro),
and print it into memory; use the last 3~5 min to quickly review what was
done(effect/cause procedure, starting from the last activities and going back to
the initial motivation)

2nd evolution: idem as 1st, but for the 4-pomodoro set. Part of the first
pomodoro is used to repeat what has been accomplished, and part of the last one
is used to review (repetition and revision being more effective in group,
talking them out loud, to stimulate overlearning and facilitate new information
acquisition)

Objective 5: Set up a timetable

The key to organizing a timetable is make conscious decisions on how to set it
up. Up to this points, sets of 4 pomodoros have been done, but depending on the
person and time of the day, sets of 3 to 5 pomodoros might be more suitable.
Experience teaches that when the seasons change, timetables need to change too.


Other objectives:

* using technology means increase in complexity due to the relative learning
  curve, and less flexibility as compared to paper, pencil and eraser.
* keep tracking at the lowest possible level of complexity, even delegating small
  tasks to recording
* keep recording simple, privilegie pencil/paper to software.
* if processing and visualizing becomes difficult, complex and repetitive, first
  ask yourself if those metrics are really necessary.
* Imagination is the most powerful tool for preventing complexity from growing.



## Results

**Learning Time**: it takes no time to apply the pomodoro technique. Mastering
it takes from 7 to 20 days of constant application. It's easier to implement the
technique consistently in pairs or teams (less learning time, more consistent
results).

**Length of the pomodoro**: Everybody is different, time is not the same in
different weeks/months, hence the ideal pomodoro is between 20 to 40 minutes
long. Experience shows that 30-min time periods works best.

**Varying the lenght of breaks**: sets breaks should vary between 15 to 30 min,
depending on how tired you feel. Exceeding 30 min risks interruting the rhythm.
If you feel that a longer break is needed, this triggers an alarm signaling the
need for rest and free time. Forcing yourself to take shorter breaks due to
pressure could lead to a mental block in finding solutions.

**Different perception of time**:
first few days bring the following benefits: sharper focus and concentration
* first 25-min pomodoros seem slowlier
* after a few days, users can feel the mid-way point of 25 min.
* by the end of the first week of constant application, users say they can feel
  when 5 min are left (feeling some sense of fatigue in those last minutes)

**Sounds of the pomodoro**:
Ticking and ringing. People feel annoyed by the ticking at first, but it becomes
a calming sound, and they end up not hearing it under concentration.
If pomodoros are done in an environment with other people who might get troubled
by these sounds, alternatives can be done using flashing and softer beeps.

**Ring Anxiety**:
People who are not used to self-discipline or very oriented toward achieving
results can feel some anxiety (fear that pomodoro could be used to externally
monitor their progress, but the aim of the technique is not to carry out any
sort of external analysis)

**When not to use the pomodoro**:
Do not use pomdoro for activities done in your free time, it wouldn't be free
time otherwise, by scheduled and goal-oriented activities.
