Objectives:

* Find out how much effort an activity requires
* Cut down on interruptions
* Estimate the effort for activities
* Make the pomodoro more effective
* Set up a timetable


Results:

* Learning time
* ...

Conclusions:

* Inverting the dependency on time
* Regulating complexity
* Detachment
* Observation and continual feedback
* Sustainable pace


Assumptions:

* Different way of seeing time alleviates anxiety and in doing so leads to
  enhanced personal effectiveness
* Better use of the mind enables us to achieve greater clarity of thoughts,
  higher consciousness, and sharper focus, all the while facilitating learning.
* Employing easy-to-use, unobtrusive tools reduces the complexity of applying
  the Technique while favoring continuity, and allows you to cconcentrate your
  efforts on the activities you want to accomplish.


Inspiration:

* Time-boxing
* Cognitive techniques described by Buzan relating to how the mind works
* Dynamics of play outlined by Gadamer
* Notions relating to structuring objectives and activities incrementally (Gilb)


Process:

* **Planning** (at the start of the day) to decide on the day's activities
* **Tracking** (throughout the day) to gather raw data on the effort expended
  and other metrics of interest
* **Recording** (at the end of the day) to compile an archive of daily
  observations
* **Processing** (and the end of the day) to transform raw data into information
* **Visualizing** (at the end of the day) to present the information in a format
  that facilitates understanding and clarifies paths to improvement.
1 iteration <= 1 day

Tools:

* A **timer**
* A **Todo Today Sheet**
    * heading: place, date, author
    * list of things to do during the day, ordered by priority
    * section "Unplanned & Urgent Activities" (updated during the day, can
      modify the day's plan)
* **Activity Inventory Sheet**
    * heading with author's name
    * number of lines where activities are noted down as they come up. At the
      end of the day, completed activities are checked off.
* A **Records Sheet** (recording, processnig, visualizing): set of raw data
  needed to produce pertinent reports and graphics. Includes date, description,
  number of pomodoros worth of effort needed to accomplish a task. Updated once
  a day in the evening.

Traditional pomodoro: 30 min (25 min work + 5 min break). This is an atomic unit
of time, indivisible. If a pomodoro is interrupted, it should be considered
void, and restarted. Once the 25min work is finished, you're not allowed to keep
on working "just for a few more minutes", even if you're convinced that in those
few minutes you could complete the task at hand.
The 3-5 min break gives time to "disconnect" from the work, and assimilate
what's been learned in the last 25 min. It allows to do healthy activities
(drink water, deep breathing, stretching exercises, joke, fantasize about the
next vacations, etc). Don't talk about work-related issues with a colleague,
don't make a phone call and don't write emails.

Every 4 pomodoro, a longer break is needed (15~30 min). 

If a task is finished before a pomodoro ended:
  * Do **overlearning**: review or repeat what you've done, make small
    improvements, note down what you've learned.
  * If the task is finished within 5 min, cancel the pomodoro and start a new
    one for the following task.

End of every day:

* Completed pomodoros transferred to hard-copy archive
* present a report with nb pomodoro / task to show effort expended: date, start
  time, type of activity, description of the activity, nb of pomodoros, short
  notes (results achieved, possible room for improvements, problems that
  happened)
 

Cut down on interruptions:

* **internal**: need to eat, drink, start a different task that seems urgent.
  This is procrastination, showing problems of concentration. To work on this,
  be aware of interruptions and clearly note them down as an apostrophe. Then
  add the new task in the "Unplanned & Urgent" section, or in the "Activity
  inventory" with a deadline if not so urgent.
  It's interesting to notice at the end of the day that seemingly urgent tasks
  aren't so important, and will be moved to the activity inventory or even
  deleted because they became irrelevant.
* **exteral**: interrupted by others. Solutions are similar to handling internal
  interruptions: Disable sonore alarms, tell the person that you're busy and
  can't be interrupted (inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule the
  interruption, etc). True emergencies that cannot wait 25min are very rare.
  People can have 10 to 15 interruptions in a single pomodoro, but if
  interruptions are well managed, it will decrease with time and interrupters
  will actually help protect the pomodoro. When an external interruption
  happens, put a dash on the sheet, apply the Inform, Negotiate and Call
  strategy. Then add the new activity in unplanned & urgent, or in the Activity
  inventory with a "U" and deadline if needed.
  If a pomodoro is definitely interrupted (real emergency or human weaknesss), it
  should be void, even if it's about to ring, and add a dash to the pomodoro
  records.
