Objectives:

* Find out how much effort an activity requires
* Cut down on interruptions
* Estimate the effort for activities
* Make the pomodoro more effective
* Set up a timetable


Results:

* Learning time
* ...

Conclusions:

* Inverting the dependency on time
* Regulating complexity
* Detachment
* Observation and continual feedback
* Sustainable pace


Assumptions:

* Different way of seeing time alleviates anxiety and in doing so leads to
  enhanced personal effectiveness
* Better use of the mind enables us to achieve greater clarity of thoughts,
  higher consciousness, and sharper focus, all the while facilitating learning.
* Employing easy-to-use, unobtrusive tools reduces the complexity of applying
  the Technique while favoring continuity, and allows you to cconcentrate your
  efforts on the activities you want to accomplish.


Inspiration:

* Time-boxing
* Cognitive techniques described by Buzan relating to how the mind works
* Dynamics of play outlined by Gadamer
* Notions relating to structuring objectives and activities incrementally (Gilb)


Process:

* **Planning** (at the start of the day) to decide on the day's activities
* **Tracking** (throughout the day) to gather raw data on the effort expended
  and other metrics of interest
* **Recording** (at the end of the day) to compile an archive of daily
  observations
* **Processing** (and the end of the day) to transform raw data into information
* **Visualizing** (at the end of the day) to present the information in a format
  that facilitates understanding and clarifies paths to improvement.
1 iteration <= 1 day

Tools:

* A **timer**
* A **Todo Today Sheet**
    * heading: place, date, author
    * list of things to do during the day, ordered by priority
    * section "Unplanned & Urgent Activities" (updated during the day, can
      modify the day's plan)
* **Activity Inventory Sheet**
    * heading with author's name
    * number of lines where activities are noted down as they come up. At the
      end of the day, completed activities are checked off.
* A **Records Sheet** (recording, processnig, visualizing): set of raw data
  needed to produce pertinent reports and graphics. Includes date, description,
  number of pomodoros worth of effort needed to accomplish a task. Updated once
  a day in the evening.

Traditional pomodoro: 30 min (25 min work + 5 min break). This is an atomic unit
of time, indivisible. If a pomodoro is interrupted, it should be considered
void, and restarted. Once the 25min work is finished, you're not allowed to keep
on working "just for a few more minutes", even if you're convinced that in those
few minutes you could complete the task at hand.
The 3-5 min break gives time to "disconnect" from the work, and assimilate
what's been learned in the last 25 min. It allows to do healthy activities
(drink water, deep breathing, stretching exercises, joke, fantasize about the
next vacations, etc). Don't talk about work-related issues with a colleague,
don't make a phone call and don't write emails.

Every 4 pomodoro, a longer break is needed (15~30 min). 

If a task is finished before a pomodoro ended:
  * Do **overlearning**: review or repeat what you've done, make small
    improvements, note down what you've learned.
  * If the task is finished within 5 min, cancel the pomodoro and start a new
    one for the following task.

End of every day:

* Completed pomodoros transferred to hard-copy archive
* present a report with nb pomodoro / task to show effort expended: date, start
  time, type of activity, description of the activity, nb of pomodoros, short
  notes (results achieved, possible room for improvements, problems that
  happened)
 

Cut down on interruptions:

* **internal**: need to eat, drink, start a different task that seems urgent.
  This is procrastination, showing problems of concentration. To work on this,
  be aware of interruptions and clearly note them down as an apostrophe. Then
  add the new task in the "Unplanned & Urgent" section, or in the "Activity
  inventory" with a deadline if not so urgent.
  It's interesting to notice at the end of the day that seemingly urgent tasks
  aren't so important, and will be moved to the activity inventory or even
  deleted because they became irrelevant.
* **external**: interrupted by others. Solutions are similar to handling internal
  interruptions: Disable sonore alarms, tell the person that you're busy and
  can't be interrupted (inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule the
  interruption, etc). True emergencies that cannot wait 25min are very rare.
  People can have 10 to 15 interruptions in a single pomodoro, but if
  interruptions are well managed, it will decrease with time and interrupters
  will actually help protect the pomodoro. When an external interruption
  happens, put a dash on the sheet, apply the Inform, Negotiate and Call
  strategy. Then add the new activity in unplanned & urgent, or in the Activity
  inventory with a "U" and deadline if needed.
  If a pomodoro is definitely interrupted (real emergency or human weaknesss), it
  should be void, even if it's about to ring, and add a dash to the pomodoro
  records.

We should delay unplanned & urgent tasks as much as possible, and reduce the
number of pomodoros used to organize those interruptions. Pleople starting to
use pomodoro often end up with 2~3 pomodoros of dedicated work/study, with the
rest of pomodoros used for unplanned tasks.

Once we start mastering pomodoro, we can work on quantitative estimates,
long-term objective being to succesfully predict the effert that an activity
requires.

At the start of the day, estimate how many pomodoros each activity in
the inventory will take (revise previous estimates if needed). Log these
estimations in the "bank". If an estimate is greater than 5~7 pomodoros, then
it's probably too complex and you should break it down in smaller tasks. If
tasks take less than a pomodoro, add them up (a pomodoro is indivisible)

When preparing the Today's tasklist, decide on the number of pomodoros to handle
(8 pomodoros is good), then choose your tasks from their pomodoro estimate until
you reach your daily quota. If tasks are completed faster than expected and
time frees up at the end of the day, pick new tasks from the inventory then.

When starting pomodoro, always start with the first activity on the list, and
keep working on it until it's done.

Advanced estimates recording:

* Analyze the estimation error (diff between actual effort and estimated one)
* Show re-estimations diff (diff between actual effort and first estimation)

how to improve quantitative estimates: eliminate the 3rd estimate while keeping
the overall margin of error small; eliminate the 2nd estimate; Reduce the margin
of error in the 1st estimate.

Manage exploration. Research tasks, preparing for tasks, all exploration tasks
can also be timeboxed in pomodoro and analyzed to see how much time is spent on
it.


Objective 4: Make the pomodoro more effective

1st evolution: use the first 3~5 min of each pomodoro to briefly repeat what
we've learned since the beginning of the activity (not just the last pomodoro),
and print it into memory; use the last 3~5 min to quickly review what was
done(effect/cause procedure, starting from the last activities and going back to
the initial motivation)

2nd evolution: idem as 1st, but for the 4-pomodoro set. Part of the first
pomodoro is used to repeat what has been accomplished, and part of the last one
is used to review (repetition and revision being more effective in group,
talking them out loud, to stimulate overlearning and facilitate new information
acquisition)

Objective 5: Set up a timetable

The key to organizing a timetable is make conscious decisions on how to set it
up. Up to this points, sets of 4 pomodoros have been done, but depending on the
person and time of the day, sets of 3 to 5 pomodoros might be more suitable.
Experience teaches that when the seasons change, timetables need to change too.


Other objectives:

* using technology means increase in complexity due to the relative learning
  curve, and less flexibility as compared to paper, pencil and eraser.
* keep tracking at the lowest possible level of complexity, even delegating small
  tasks to recording
* keep recording simple, privilegie pencil/paper to software.
* if processing and visualizing becomes difficult, complex and repetitive, first
  ask yourself if those metrics are really necessary.
* Imagination is the most powerful tool for preventing complexity from growing.



# Results

**Learning Time**: it takes no time to apply the pomodoro technique. Mastering
it takes from 7 to 20 days of constant application. It's easier to implement the
technique consistently in pairs or teams (less learning time, more consistent
results).

**Length of the pomodoro**: Everybody is different, time is not the same in
different weeks/months, hence the ideal pomodoro is between 20 to 40 minutes
long. Experience shows that 30-min time periods works best.

**Varying the lenght of breaks**: sets breaks should vary between 15 to 30 min,
depending on how tired you feel. Exceeding 30 min risks interruting the rhythm.
If you feel that a longer break is needed, this triggers an alarm signaling the
need for rest and free time. Forcing yourself to take shorter breaks due to
pressure could lead to a mental block in finding solutions.

**Different perception of time**:
first few days bring the following benefits: sharper focus and concentration
* first 25-min pomodoros seem slowlier
* after a few days, users can feel the mid-way point of 25 min.
* by the end of the first week of constant application, users say they can feel
  when 5 min are left (feeling some sense of fatigue in those last minutes)

**Sounds of the pomodoro**:
Ticking and ringing. People feel annoyed by the ticking at first, but it becomes
a calming sound, and they end up not hearing it under concentration.
If pomodoros are done in an environment with other people who might get troubled
by these sounds, alternatives can be done using flashing and softer beeps.

**Ring Anxiety**:
People who are not used to self-discipline or very oriented toward achieving
results can feel some anxiety (fear that pomodoro could be used to externally
monitor their progress, but the aim of the technique is not to carry out any
sort of external analysis)

**When not to use the pomodoro**:
Do not use pomdoro for activities done in your free time, it wouldn't be free
time otherwise, by scheduled and goal-oriented activities.



# Best app

* Progressive learning: Start easy, then after some time has passed and
  progresses have shown up, add expert features for more control
* Allow pomodoro lists to be shareable/public: by doing so, the user is commited
  to his objectives, and can receive feedback from friends.
* Notifications at different times of the day to handle important tasks
  (preparing the day in the morning, analysing in the evening etc)
