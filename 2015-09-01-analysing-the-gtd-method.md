# Notes

**Problem:** new demands, insufficient resource. Work no longer has clear
boundaries, our jobs keep changing, the old models and habits are insufficient.

**Promise**: the "ready state" of the martial artist, "mind like water", "the
zone".

To reduce stress, we need to control the "open loops" of our lives, all the
responsabilities that we're assigning to ourselves, littles things that are
"ringing a bell" in some way, then plan how to handle them.

Anything that is on our mind should be captured, or it will keep disturb us
until we take care of it. We should clarify that commitment and plan how to
fulfill it. Finally, we should keep reminders of these steps organized in a
system that we review regularly.

We should not manage priorities, but manage actions. Priorities are there
already.

Horizontal Management: Maintains coherence across all the activities in which
you are involved: todo list
Vertical control: manages thinking up and down the track of individual topics
and projects: project planning


## 5 stages of mastering Workflow

Horizontal  management:

1. **Collect** things that command our attention
2. **Process** what they mean and what to do about them
3. **Organize** the results, which we
4. **Review** as options for what we choose to
5. **Do**

**Incomplete:** Any task that has a "should", "need to" or "ought to" attached
to its description.

Collection tools (containers to hold items that require being cleaned regularly):
physical in-basket, paper-based note-taking devices,
electronic note-taking devices, voice-recording devices, emails.

Collection phase:
1. Every open loop must be in the collection system and out of your head
2. You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with.
3. You must empty them regularly.

**No more "Daily To-Do" Lists:** Time-specific actions, day-specific actions
and day-specific information are all that goes into a calendar, and nothing
else. Traditional time-management training always place the "daily to-do list"
as key, but such lists don't work:
* constant new input and shifting tactical priorities reconfigure daily work so
  consistently that it's near impossible to nail down to-do items ahead of time.
* If something in the daily to-do list doesn't absolutely have to get done that
  day, it will dilute the emphasis in the things that truly do.
A calendar should be sacred territory: if you write something there, it must get
done that day or never. Only appointments can be rescheduled.

The **Next actions** list takes any longer-than-two-minutes, nondelegatable
action. Since this list can easily reach hundreds of items, it makes sense to
subdivide it into categories.

Personal organization system:
* "Projects" list
* Calendar
* "Next actions" lists
* "Waiting for" & "Someday/Maybe" list


**Weekly review: 10,000 foot level**: Take a look at all your outstanding
projects and open loops on a weekly basis.
* Gather and process all your "stuff"
* Review your system
* Update your lists
* Get clean, clear, current, and complete
